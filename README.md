# MLflow Pipelines Regression Template
This repository serves as a customizable template for the
[MLflow Regression Pipeline](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/pipelines.html#regression-pipeline)
to develop high-quality production-ready regression models.

Currently supported ML models are limited to scikit-learn and frameworks that
integrate with scikit-learn, such as the ``XGBRegressor`` API from XGBoost.

**Note**: [MLflow Pipelines](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/pipelines.html)
is an experimental feature in [MLflow](https://mlflow.org).
If you observe any issues,
please report them [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues).
For suggestions on improvements,
please file a discussion topic [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/discussions).
Your contribution to MLflow Pipelines is greatly appreciated by the community!

## Installation instructions
(Optional) Create a clean Python environment either via
[virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv) or
[conda](https://pypi.org/project/conda) for the best experience.
Python 3.7 or higher is required.

1. Install the latest MLflow with Pipelines:
```
pip install "mlflow[pipelines]"  # for pip
conda install -c conda-forge mlflow-pipelines  # for conda
```

2. Clone this MLflow Regression Pipeline template repository locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/mlflow/mlp-regression-template.git
```

3. Enter the root directory of the cloned pipeline template:
```
cd mlp-regression-template
```

4. Install the template dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Log to the designated MLflow Experiment
To log pipeline runs to a particular MLflow experiment:
1. Open `profiles/databricks.yaml` or `profiles/local.yaml`, depending on your environment.
2. Edit (and uncomment, if necessary) the `experiment` section, specifying the name of the
   desired experiment for logging.

## Development Environment -- Databricks
[Sync](https://docs.databricks.com/repos.html) this repository with
[Databricks Repos](https://docs.databricks.com/repos.html) and run the `notebooks/databricks`
notebook on a Databricks Cluster running version 11.0 or greater of the
[Databricks Runtime](https://docs.databricks.com/runtime/dbr.html) or the
[Databricks Runtime for Machine Learning](https://docs.databricks.com/runtime/mlruntime.html)
with [workspace files support enabled](https://docs.databricks.com/repos.html#work-with-non-notebook-files-in-a-databricks-repo).

**Note**: When making changes to pipelines on Databricks,
it is recommended that you edit files on your local machine and
use [dbx](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/dbx.html) to sync them to Databricks Repos, as
demonstrated [here](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/pipelines.html#usage)

### Accessing MLflow Pipeline Runs
You can find MLflow Experiments and MLflow Runs created by the pipeline on the
[Databricks ML Experiments page](https://docs.databricks.com/applications/machine-learning/experiments-page.html#experiments).

## Development Environment -- Local machine
### Jupyter

1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook environment via the `jupyter notebook` command.
2. Open and run the `notebooks/jupyter.ipynb` notebook in the Jupyter environment.

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

First, enter the template root directory and set the profile via environment variable
```
cd mlp-regression-template
```
```
export MLFLOW_PIPELINES_PROFILE=local
```

Then, try running the
following [MLflow Pipelines CLI](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/cli.html#mlflow-pipelines)
commands to get started.
Note that the `--step` argument is optional.
Pipeline commands without a `--step` specified act on the entire pipeline instead.

Available step names are: `ingest`, `split`, `transform`, `train`, `evaluate` and `register`.

- Display the help message:
```
mlflow pipelines --help
```

- Run a pipeline step or the entire pipeline:
```
mlflow pipelines run --step step_name
```

- Inspect a step card or the pipeline dependency graph:
```
mlflow pipelines inspect --step step_name
```

- Clean a step cache or all step caches:
```
mlflow pipelines clean --step step_name
```

**Note**: a short cut to `mlflow pipelines` is installed as `mlp`.
For example, to run the ingest step,
instead of issuing `mlflow pipelines run --step ingest`, you may type
```
mlp -s ingest
```

### Accessing MLflow Pipeline Runs
To view MLflow Experiments and MLflow Runs created by the pipeline:

1. Enter the template root directory: `cd mlp-regression-template`

2. Start the MLflow UI

```sh
mlflow ui \
   --backend-store-uri sqlite:///metadata/mlflow/mlruns.db \
   --default-artifact-root ./metadata/mlflow/mlartifacts \
   --host localhost
```

3. Open a browser tab pointing to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
